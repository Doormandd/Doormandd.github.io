# Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

GIS (Geographic Information System) is a computer system designed to capture, store, manage, analyze, and display spatially referenced data. It combines geographic data with attribute data, presenting spatial information intuitively through maps, charts, and reports.

## What is GIS?

GIS is an integrated system of hardware, software, and data used to capture, manage, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced data. Simply put, GIS is a tool for analyzing data and problems on a map.

## Core Components of GIS

### 1. Hardware
- Computers (workstations, servers)
- Input devices (scanners, GPS receivers)
- Output devices (printers, plotters)

### 2. Software
- GIS software (such as ArcGIS, QGIS, MapGIS)
- Database management systems
- Data processing and analysis tools

### 3. Data
- Spatial data (vector, raster)
- Attribute data (tables, text, images)
- Metadata (data description information)

### 4. People
- GIS professionals
- Data analysts
- Decision makers
